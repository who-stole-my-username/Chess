# Project has been canceled!

This is a school project we are working on in the IMS.

Ours is the only project in the entire class that doesn't focus on gambling.

For some reason, we are required to implement the project in Java, even though it uses more than 100 times as much memory as C and over 10 times as much as Python.

However, my friend and I decided to develop a chess game (maybe). We don’t think it’s too complex (well, maybe it is...), but it should be impressive enough to stand out and earn us a good grade.

The project isn't done jet, but we had to hand it in to our techer so yesss... not that good, I think.

So that means, that I won't continue to finish it. I have already told you that I don't really like Java.
